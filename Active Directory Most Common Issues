Detailed Guide for Level 1 IT Support Technicians: Active Directory Basics

1. Understanding User Accounts

Key Concepts:

User Account Creation: Each user needs an account to access domain resources.

Password Management: Ensures security and accessibility.

Account Lockouts: Occur due to multiple failed login attempts or cached credentials.

Where to Find Instructions:

These instructions can be found in the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) management console, typically installed on domain controllers or administrative workstations with RSAT tools.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

a. Creating a User Account:

Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

Navigate to the Organizational Unit (OU) where the user account will reside.

Right-click the OU and select New > User.

Fill in the user’s first name, last name, and logon name, then click Next.

Set an initial password and configure password options (e.g., "User must change password at next logon").

Click Finish to create the account.

b. Resetting a Password:

Open ADUC and locate the user account.

Right-click the account and select Reset Password.

Enter the new password and confirm it.

Optionally, check "User must change password at next logon."

Click OK.

c. Unlocking a Locked Account:

Locate the user account in ADUC.

Right-click the account and select Properties.

Go to the Account tab.

Check the box labeled Unlock Account (if available).

Click OK.




2. Groups and Permissions

Key Concepts:

Security Groups: Used to assign permissions to resources.

Distribution Groups: Used for email distribution lists.

Group Scopes: Define how groups can be used across domains (Domain Local, Global, Universal).

Where to Find Instructions:

Group management tasks can also be performed in the ADUC console under the "Groups" section within the appropriate Organizational Unit.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

a. Adding a User to a Group:

Open ADUC and locate the group.

Right-click the group and select Properties.

Go to the Members tab and click Add.

Enter the username or browse for the user account.

Click OK to add the user.

b. Removing a User from a Group:

Open ADUC and locate the group.

Right-click the group and select Properties.

Go to the Members tab.

Select the user and click Remove.

Click OK to save changes.




3. Organizational Units (OUs) and Structure

Key Concepts:

OUs: Containers for organizing users, groups, and computers.

Hierarchy: Reflects the organizational structure and allows delegation of administrative tasks.

Where to Find Instructions:

Tasks involving OUs can be managed through the ADUC console, accessible via administrative tools on a domain controller or workstation with RSAT installed.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

a. Moving an Object to a Different OU:

Open ADUC and locate the object (user, group, or computer).

Right-click the object and select Move.

Choose the target OU from the list.

Click OK to move the object.

b. Creating a New OU:

In ADUC, right-click the domain or an existing OU.

Select New > Organizational Unit.

Enter a name for the new OU and click OK.




4. Group Policy Basics

Key Concepts:

Group Policy Objects (GPOs): Used to enforce settings across users and computers.

Common Policies: Include password complexity, login scripts, and desktop restrictions.

Where to Find Instructions:

Group Policy settings can be managed through the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), which is installed on domain controllers or administrative workstations with RSAT tools.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

a. Viewing Applied GPOs:

On a user’s computer, open Command Prompt.

Run the command: gpresult /r.

Review the list of applied GPOs under User Settings and Computer Settings.

b. Forcing a GPO Update:

Open Command Prompt on the affected computer.

Run the command: gpupdate /force.

Wait for the process to complete and restart the computer if prompted.




5. Basic Troubleshooting Tools

Key Concepts:

ADUC: Main tool for managing AD objects.

Event Viewer: Used to diagnose login and authentication issues.

Command-Line Tools: Useful for network and authentication troubleshooting.

Where to Find Instructions:

ADUC: Accessible on domain controllers or administrative workstations with RSAT tools.

Event Viewer: Found on any Windows computer by searching for "Event Viewer" in the Start menu.

Command-Line Tools: Available on any Windows system.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

a. Using Event Viewer to Check Login Issues:

On the user’s computer, open Event Viewer (search for it in the Start menu).

Navigate to Windows Logs > Security.

Look for Event IDs related to login issues (e.g., 4625 for failed logins).

b. Verifying User Details with Command-Line Tools:

Open Command Prompt.

Run the command: whoami to confirm the logged-in user.

Run nslookup <domain> to verify DNS resolution for the domain.
